  <h1>Old Wedding Rituals in Ukraine</h1>
<p>
Wedding rituals in Ukraine, as in all Slavic cultures, traditionally began with matchmaking. The groomâ€™s representatives, known as "matchmakers," would visit the girl's parents to ask for her hand in marriage. This request was often made in a humorous, allegorical manner.

The bride herself did not participate in the negotiations, but she had the chance to express her opinion indirectly. If she agreed to the proposal, she would pretend to be busy cooking at the oven. However, if she did not approve, she would present a pumpkin to the matchmakers, a gesture known as <span>"giving the pumpkin"</span> symbolizing rejection.
</p>
<p>
To avoid such public embarrassment, the matchmakers would often try to learn the girl's and her parents' intentions in advance, a process known as "reconnaissance."
</p>
<p>
If both the girl and her parents consented to the marriage, the bride-to-be would give hand-embroidered towels to the matchmakers as a sign of acceptance. Her parents would then offer fresh bread to the future in-laws as part of the celebration.
